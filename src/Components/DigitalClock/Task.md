 **technical task** that takes around **40 minutes** to complete, has some **logical depth**, and is a little **tricky** (not just a plain digital clock).

Here’s a **refined interview-style task**:

### 🧑‍💻 Interview Task – Advanced Digital Clock

**Problem Statement:**
Build a **live updating Digital Clock** in JavaScript that:

1. Displays the **current time** in `HH:MM:SS` format (24-hour).
2. Updates every **1 second** using `setInterval`.
3. Has a **"Toggle Format" button** to switch between:

   * 12-hour format with AM/PM
   * 24-hour format
4. Show the **current day of the week** (e.g., "Sunday").
5. Add a **"Pause / Resume" button** that stops and restarts the clock updates.
6. Bonus (tricky part):

   * If the user opens the page at, say, `14:59:58`, the clock should **still sync correctly with the system clock** (not drift over time due to interval delays).
   * Hint: use `Date` object instead of only incrementing seconds manually.

### 📌 Expectations

* Use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (React/TS optional if candidate prefers).
* Code should be **readable** and **modular**.
* Edge case handling (e.g., 12 AM, 12 PM transitions).

---

### 🎯 Difficulty Balance

* Base digital clock: Easy (10–15 mins).
* Format toggle + day of week: Moderate (10–15 mins).
* Pause/Resume + syncing correctly: Tricky (10–15 mins).
  ➡️ Total: \~40 mins.

Would you like me to **also prepare the evaluation guide** (like what you as interviewer should check: logic, code clarity, edge cases, etc.) so you can directly use it in the interview?
